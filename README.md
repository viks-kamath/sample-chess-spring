Chess moves validation algorithm (Mavenized, Spring, Junit)

<b>Description</b>: Algorithm(s) that identifies if a given move made on the chess board (simulated as a 2D array) is valid <br>
<b>Technology</b>: Java, Spring, Maven, JUnit, Annotations<br>
<b>Design Pattern</b>: Template Pattern, Factory Pattern<br>
<b>Tools/ IDE</b>: Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite (recommended) <br>

<b>Instructions:</b><br>
1) The Test Classes are self explanatory. They give the idea of what is being validated. Also, they show the 2D representation of a chess board position. For each of the test cases/methods, the 2D array may be changed for analysing<br>
2) To begin with, start with RookMoveValidatorTest.java<br>
3) and run the Junit<br>
